Sure, here is the C++ code to print Hebrew:
C++

using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "שלום";
  return 0;
}

This code outputs the following Hebrew word:

שלום

The word "שלום" means "hello" in Hebrew.

To compile and run this code, you can use the following steps:

    Save the code as a file called print_hebrew.cpp.
    Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
    Run the following command to compile the code:

g++ -o print_hebrew print_hebrew.cpp

This will create an executable file called print_hebrew.

    Run the following command to run the code:

./print_hebrew

This will print the Hebrew word "שלום" to the console.

I hope this helps!
